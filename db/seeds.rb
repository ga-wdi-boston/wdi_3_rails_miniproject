# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# p1 = Post.create(title: 'Best Restaurant', author: 'Cenk Yurtbilir', content: 'Au Cheval is the best burger place in Chicago')
# p2 = Post.create(title: 'Iphone6', author: 'Steve Jobs', content: 'We did not create a new smart phone, we are just ripping you off')
# p3 = Post.create(title: 'Google', author: 'Memo Kuran', content: 'Google is investin in Robotics')

# p1.comments.create(comment: 'So true')
# p2.comments.create(comment: 'Isnt this guy invented the Iphone6')
# p2.comments.create(comment: 'Idiot')
# p3.comments.create(comment: 'Agreed and Approved.')
