# Week 3 Rails Miniproject

Take a project of your choice (a lab, a homework, or something new) and make it as good as you can. Spend some time on both the *functionality* (routes, models, controllers) and the *design* (views, HTML, CSS). 

At minimum, your code should be in a working state, even if it doesn't do all the things you intended it to do. 

Remember to make lots of git commits with helpful commit messages! Making lots of commits also helps with keeping code in a working state, so if something breaks, you can easily go back to the last point when your app was working.

## To submit your work 

Please deploy your code to Heroku and then submit a pull request. In your pull request message, paste in your Heroku URL (otherwise we have no idea where to look for it).

# Rails Blog with has_many

Make a blog. It will have posts. The posts have comments. This is for you to practice and explore. Use everything we've learned so far. Push yourself as far as you can. 

## Additional explorations: 

- Make the comments have nested comments under them, like Hacker News or Reddit
- Use *validations* to ensure the posts and comments have the required data, and of the proper and expected type. 
- Make it so that blog posts belong to a category, so that they can be viewed by category
- Figure out *pagination*, so that your index page isn't potentially hundreds of blog posts, but rather pages through 5 or 10 at a time
- Implement user authentication so that posts and comments can only be done by registered users. Use Warden or Devise for this. 
- Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, or create your own CSS stylesheets from scratch
- Deploy to Heroku
